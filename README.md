## Overview

The application processes financial transaction data sent via HTTP POST requests, anonymizes sensitive user details, calculates risk scores for transactions, and stores the results securely.

## Technical Requirements

- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- TypeScript
- Node.js Crypto Module
- AWS S3 (optional, for secure storage)

## Project Specifications

### API Endpoint Setup

- Implement an API Gateway to accept POST requests with financial transaction data in JSON format.
- Validate incoming data structure rigorously.

### Complex Data Processing Logic

- **Anonymization**: Anonymize personal identifiers in the data.
- **Encryption and Hashing**: Encrypt the anonymized data using AES-256 and RSA for key parts.
- **Risk Assessment Algorithm**: Evaluate the risk associated with each transaction.
- **Data Enrichment**: Integrate external data sources to enrich the transaction data.

### Storage and Retrieval

- Store processed results securely in a DynamoDB table (or optionally in an S3 bucket).
- Provide a retrieval mechanism through a Lambda function.

### Testing

- Develop comprehensive unit tests for each component.
- Test data enrichment integrations and anonymization consistency.

### Documentation

- Document each component of the system, the flow of data, and the logic behind the risk assessment algorithms.
- Provide a detailed guide on setting up and testing the entire setup.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Node.js and npm installed
- Serverless Framework installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
